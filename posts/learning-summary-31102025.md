Intro

The intention of this post is to share my current progress in my learning journey and perhaps help motivate others to start their own. I think its too easy to assume that you will understanding something given time and repetition, which is true, especially if you are consistently facing new venues for learning day-in and day-out. I'd say that for the majority of people, work can become repetitive and familiar leading to a reduction in opportunities to learn and therefore slowing or stagnating learning. Also, in a changing tech world, now more than ever, it is vital to stay relevant considering the rise of new technologies and how they integrate and elevate current solutions and ways of working.

The topics I am covering in my current 6 month syllabus are below:

- MSSQL for Database Administration and development, since this is core to my role and an imperative RDBMS in the industry. 
- SQL Query Tuning; deserving of its own section in my schedule considering the titan that the SQL Query Processor can be and that proficiency will be utilised in data manipulation in general and can be applied to any SQL technology
- Microsoft Fabric in the spirit learning new technologies, fabric is central in this space as it is revolutionary in its nature of having all platforms in one space.
- Python to support my effectiveness in Fabric as it is industry-leading for Data Science and file manipulation.
