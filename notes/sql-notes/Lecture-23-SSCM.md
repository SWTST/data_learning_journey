# SQL Server Configuration Manager (SSCM)

SQL Server configuration Manager is used to manager services associated with SQL Server, to configure the network protocols used by SQL Server, and to manage the network connectivity configuration from SQL Server client computers. It is automatically installed with SQL Server.

SSMS and SSCM use WMI to view and change some server settings.
